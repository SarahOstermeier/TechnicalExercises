            "Cellular respiration is a metabolic process that occurs in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the primary energy currency of the cell. This process is crucial for the survival and functioning of living organisms. Cellular respiration can be broken down into three main stages:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Glycolysis**: This is the first stage of cellular respiration, occurring in the cytoplasm of the cell. During glycolysis, one molecule of glucose (a six-carbon sugar) is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate (a three-carbon compound), generating a small amount of ATP and NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)**: The pyruvate molecules produced in glycolysis are transported into the mitochondria, where they are further broken down through a series of reactions known as the Krebs cycle. This cycle produces additional ATP, NADH, and FADH2 (flavin adenine dinucleotide), as well as carbon dioxide (CO2) as a byproduct.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Electron Transport Chain and Oxidative Phosphorylation**: The NADH and FADH2 produced in the previous stages donate electrons to the electron transport chain, which is located in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. As electrons pass through a series of protein complexes, they release energy that is used to pump protons (H+) across the membrane, creating a pH gradient. This gradient drives the synthesis of ATP through a process called oxidative phosphorylation, which is the final stage of cellular respiration.\n",
